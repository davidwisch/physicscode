# Getting Involved

*Physicscode* is a completely open source project and everyone is welcome (and encouraged!) to contribute.  We're looking for people help us expand our content, improve our code, design our site, and even help fix our spelling and grammar errors.

## Technology

We've worked very hard to keep the technology behind *Physicscode* simple and straightforward.  We want people to be able to contribute quickly and with as little a learning curve as possible.  That being said, there are a few technologies that you'll need to become framiliar with.

### Need to Know

* **git** - [Git](http://git-scm.com) is a version control system that we use to keep track of all of our code.  It has a slight learning curve but is an absolutly essential tool when contributing to *Physicscode*.  Awesome tutorials can be found [here](http://help.github.com/), [here](http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html), [here](http://help.github.com/forking/), and [here](http://progit.org/).

* **GitHub** -  [GitHub](http://github.com) hosts all of the code that powers *Physicscode*.  This is where all of the contributers submit their code, discuss new features, manage todo lists, etc.  If you're serious about contributing to *Physicscode*, you should create a GitHub account and become framilar with git and the GitHub interface.

* **Jekyll** - [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator.  We don't directly write *Physicscode* in HTML.  Instead we write our content in Markdown (see next bullet) and let Jekyll build the HTML for us.  Jekyll lets us write our content simply, efficiently use templates to control look & feel, and perform pesudo-dynamic operations without requring us actually write the site in a dynamic language.

* **Markdown** - [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdow) is a text-to-HTML conversion tool.  We write all of our [non source code] content in Markdown then let Jekyll transform the Markdown into standard HTML.  Markdown is exceptionally simple to learn and makes writing content for simple websites as easy as writing any word document (maybe even easier!).

### Nice to Know

While the following technologies are used in parts of *Physicscode* they are not, strictly speaking, *required knowledge*.  However, to be an *elite* *Physicscode* developer you should probably know them, at least to some degree.

* **HTML** - [HTML]() is the markup language behind most of the internet.  Even though we [mostly] don't mix HTML and our [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) code, HTML is still used to write our templates an provide some additional functionality that isn't supported within Markdown.  Besides, if you're going to be writing websites of any kind, you should know HTML.

* **Ruby** - [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) is a dynamic programming language that's similar to Python.  While Ruby is not a language that we use when writing our code examples, it is the language that powers certain parts of *Physicscode*.  All of our [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) [plugins](#technology-plugins) are written in Ruby, part of our *deploy process* is written in Ruby, and infact even Jekyll itself is written in Ruby (although not by us).

* **Javascript/jQuery** - [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) while used as little as possible (not because we don't like it but because we want to keep the site simpe) still provides some additional dynamic functionality in various places throughout *Physicscode*.
