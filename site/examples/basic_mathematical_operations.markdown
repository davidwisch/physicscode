# Basic Mathematical Operations

Most programming languages have builtin functions for performing basic, and sometimes even moderatly advanced mathematical functions.  Here we'll show you how to perform basic arithmetic, use functions like sine, cosine, and tangent, as well as some basic logarithms.

Mathematica has a HUGE number of build in numberical functions and libraries, far exeeding the number in native Python, C++, or Fortran.

**Choose your language:**

* [Python](#python)
* [C++](#cpp)
* [Fortran](#fortran)
* [Mathematica](#mathematica)

## Python

Python gives you access to some functions without you needing to do anything.  However, sometimes, and in the case of mathematical functions, they need to be imported before you have access to them.  The Python library that contains mathematical functions is simply called 'math'.

You can find a complete list of math functions in Python [here](http://docs.python.org/library/math.html).

Here is an example of a Python program that demonstrates the use of some basic arithmetic, as well as more advanced functions like sine, cosine, tangent, and log.
