# Working with Arrays

Arrays are incredibly usefull for storing generated or related data.  Arrays are easy to comprehend if you think of them as lists of related data.  Also, they closely resemble matricies from mathematics.

For example, in a simulation of a skater on ice, you may want to keep track of their position and velocity over the duration of the simulation.  Declaring many variables to store this information is silly when instead you can store everything you need in an array.

All four of our languages support some kind of an array.  Their specific implementations are quite different, however.

**Choose your language:**

* [Python](#python)
* [C++](#cpp)
* [Fortran](#fortran)
* [Mathematica](#mathematica)

## Python

Arrays in Python are very different from their C++ or Fortran counterparts.  Python's implementation of the array is one of the weaker aspects of the language (at least from a computational physics perspective) but can be made to work.  Usually, although Python does have an "array" datatype, array-like behavior is implemented using the 'list' datatype instead.  Multidimentional arrays are an especially weak point in the Python language but an example of a multidimentional structure using embedded lists is provided.

When speed or more flexibility is needed, it is reccomended that you use the [NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org/) addon package for Python.  It includes a "correct" implementation of arrays and multidimentional arrays (as well as many other physics goodies).  An example using NumPy is also provided.
