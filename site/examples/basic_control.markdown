# Controlling The Flow of Your Programs

**Choose your language:**

Very often is it necessary to change the execution of your program based on certain parameters or conditions.  Imagine if you were writing a program that would display if a number was negative or positive, or similarly, if a number was even or odd.  You would need to use an **IF** statement in order to direct your program through different paths of execution.

This guide will show you the syntax of **IF**, **ELSE IF**, and **ELSE** statments. A brief discussion on **AND** and **OR** statements is alsoincluded.

If you want to get fancy, you can read about [ternary operations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_operation).

## Python

In Python, control is build using **if**, **elif**, and **else** statments.

You can read *much* more about python control structures [here](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/controlflow.html).

Here is an example of a program that prints out if a number is positive or negative:

**NOTE:** The *raw_input* function is simply a way to accept user input into your program, it is unrelated to the proper function of the control statments.

File: src/python/basic_control.py
{% highlight python %}
{% file python/basic_control.py %}
{% endhighlight %}

In addition to if/elif/else, Python supports **and** and **or** operations that are usefull.

Here is a weak example of how to use them:

File: src/python/basic_control_andor.py
{% highlight python %}
{% file python/basic_control_andor.py %}
{% endhighlight %}

There are other operations, not mentioned here, that could be usefull.  See the [official documentation](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/controlflow.html) for mroe information.
