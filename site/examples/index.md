# Code Examples

## Basic Operations

This section contains code examples outlining basic operations that many programs will require.  Every programmer should be able to do these basic things.

While the guides do not *need* to be read in order, if you're new to programming it's highly recommended that you read them in the order that they're presented.

1. [Compiling/Running a program](/examples/basic_compiling.html)
2. [Declaring variables](/examples/basic_variable_declarations.html)
3. [Mathematical operations](/examples/basic_mathematical_operations.html)
4. [Control Statements](/examples/basic_control.html)
5. [Loop Structures](/examples/basic_looping.html)
6. [Working with arrays](/examples/basic_arrays.html)
7. [Reading/Writing data from/to a file](/examples/basic_reading_writing.html)
8. [Writing Basic Functions](/examples/basic_functions.html)

## Putting it all Together

This section contains programs that are mashups of the various skills discussed in the "Basic Operations" section.  Programs are all physics related and resemble the type of problems that you may be asked to solve on an assignment.

* [An Interesting Function](/examples/putting_interesting.html)

## Physics

This section contains examples of programs (of varying complexity and topics) that you're likely to encounter in a computational physics curriculum.
