# Code Examples

## Basic Operations

This section contains code examples outlining basic operations that many programs will require.  Every programmer should be able to do these basic things.

While the guides below do not strictly require the previous ones if you're new to programming it's highly reccomended that you read them in the order presented.

1. [Compiling/Running a program](/examples/basic_compiling.html)
2. [Declaring variables](/examples/basic_variable_declarations.html)
3. [Mathematical operations](/examples/basic_mathematical_operations.html)
4. [Control Statements](/examples/basic_control.html)
5. [Loop Structures](/examples/basic_looping.html)
6. [Working with arrays](/examples/basic_arrays.html)
7. [Reading/Writing data from/to a file](/examples/basic_reading_writing.html)
8. [Writing Basic Functions](/examples/basic_functions.html)

## Putting it all Together

This section contains programs that are mashups of the various skills discussed in the "Basic Operations" section.  Programs are of the type that you may be required to write for an assignment.

## Physics

This section contains examples of programs (of varying complexity and topics) that you're likely to see in a computational physics program.
