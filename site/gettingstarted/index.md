# Getting Started

This guide provides examples of coding techniques useful in an undergraduate physics program.  This guide is officially supports two programming languages ([Python](http://www.python.org/) and  [Fortran (90/95)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran)).  You will need to install one of these in order to effectively use the examples in this guide.  See the pages below for help.


## Python
[http://www.python.org](http://www.python.org)

Python is a general purpose scripting language known for its simplicity and ease of use.

**The following guides are available for Python:**

## Fortran
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran)

Fortran has roots that go as far back as the 1950's.  It has a strong history with various engineering disiplines and the physical sciences.  It is also the "official" language of the Illinois State University Physics Department.
