# File: src/python/basic_variables.py

# This is how you create variables in Python
firstname = "John"
lastname = "Doe"
age = 45
height = 1.8 #meters

# We can change the value of a variable like so
age = 50 # John is now 50 years old
age = 45 # John is 45 again

# Now let's use those variables
print firstname, lastname, "is", age, "years old and is", height, "m tall."
