# Getting Started

This guide provides examples of coding techniques usefull in an undergraduate physics program.  This guide is officially supports three programming laguages ([Python](http://www.python.org/), [C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B), and [Fortran (90/95)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran)) as well as [Mathematica](http://www.wolfram.com/).  You will need to install one of these in order to effectivly use the examples in thie guide.  See the pages below for help.

## Python
[http://www.python.org](http://www.python.org)

Python is a general purpose scripting language known for its simplicity and ease of use.

**Please read [Installing/Configuring Python](/gettingstarted/python.html) to get started.**

## C++
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)

C++ does stuff fast.  You can also write operating systems in it.  (RJ should write this section).

**Please read [Installing/Configuring C++](/gettingstarted/cpp.html) to get started.**

## Fortran
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran)

Fortran has roots that go as far back as the 1950's.  It has a strong history with various engineering disiplines and the physical sciences.  It is also the "official" language of the Illinois State University Physics Department.

**Please read [Installing/Configuring Fortran](/gettingstarted/fortran.html) to get started.**

## Mathematica
[http://www.wolfram.com](http://www.wolfram.com)

Mathematica is a computational software program developed by Wolfram Research.  Mathematica is proprietary software and thus cannot be freely aquired.  Talk to your system administrator or refer to the [Wolfram](http://www.wolfram.com/) website to assistance aquiring and installing Mathematica.
